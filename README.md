- This web app is developed to help Manipal University students.
- They face problem to find people who share cab with them.
- As cab charges high fare students do alternative things to find people using Whatsapp groups, Google forms etc.
- As it is not fusible to share personal information like phone no etc there is a risk of misuse of there data.
- My friend come up with an idea who also suffering from this problem.
- Our idea is simply we do not store users Personal data, and make it accessible to everyone there is no mediator to find people who are interested to share cab with them.
- People come to website and post for requirements. If anyone find it similar them he/she request for the same.
- After the completion of request the Post automatically deleted.
- We do not store any kind of data.
